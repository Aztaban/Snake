# Snake Game

A simple classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:

- Mobile-friendly controls
- Persistent high score leaderboard (with Vercel serverless functions)
- Simple and clean design

## To Run

This project uses Vercel serverless functions for the leaderboard.

To run properly:

1. Deploy to Vercel (`vercel deploy`)
2. Or serve locally with a static server and API support

Opening `index.html` directly won't enable high score saving.
